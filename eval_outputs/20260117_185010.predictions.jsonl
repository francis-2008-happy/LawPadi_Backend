{"id": "Q008", "question": "What is the doctrine of separation of powers in Nigeria?", "model_answer": "SEPARATION OF POWERS\n\nThe doctrine of separation of powers in Nigeria is enshrined in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Constitution provides for the separation of powers among the three arms of government: the Legislative, the Executive, and the Judiciary.\n\nAccording to Section 4 of the Constitution, the legislative powers of the Federal Republic of Nigeria are vested in the National Assembly. Section 5 of the Constitution vests the executive powers of the Federation in the President, while Section 6 vests the judicial powers of the Federation in the courts.\n\nThe separation of powers is further reinforced by the provisions of Sections 4, 5, and 6 of the Constitution, which provide that each arm of government has distinct and separate powers and functions. For instance, the National Assembly has the power to make laws, the President has the power to execute the laws, and the courts have the power to interpret the laws.\n\nThe doctrine of separation of powers is designed to prevent any one arm of government from dominating the others, and to ensure that power is distributed evenly among the three arms. This is to prevent abuse of power and to ensure that each arm of government checks and balances the others.\n\nIn the case of Attorney-General of Abia State v. Attorney-General of the Federation (2002) 6 NWLR (Pt. 764) 542, the Supreme Court held that the doctrine of separation of powers is a fundamental principle of the Constitution, and that each arm of government must respect the powers and functions of the other arms.\n\nIn conclusion, the doctrine of separation of powers in Nigeria is a constitutional principle that ensures that power is distributed evenly among the three arms of government, and that each arm checks and balances the others to prevent abuse of power.\n\nRELEVANT AUTHORITIES:\n- Section 4 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria\n- Section 5 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria\n- Section 6 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria\n- Attorney-General of Abia State v.

However, the Criminal Code Act, which is applicable in the Southern part of Nigeria, provides for the punishment of murder in Section 319. According to this section, any person who unlawfully kills another person is guilty of murder and is liable to imprisonment for life.\n\nFurthermore, Section 316 of the Criminal Code Act provides that a person is deemed to have unlawfully killed another person if they intentionally cause the death of that person, or if they cause the death of that person with the intention of causing them grievous harm, or if they cause the death of that person with the knowledge that their act is likely to cause the death of that person.\n\nIn addition, the Supreme Court of Nigeria has held in various cases that murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.

{"id": "Q013", "question": "What is the difference between murder and manslaughter?", "model_answer": "DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MURDER AND MANSLAUGHTER\n\nThe difference between murder and manslaughter is primarily based on the intent and circumstances surrounding the killing. According to the Criminal Code, murder is defined in Section 316 as the unlawful killing of another person under certain circumstances, including where the offender intends to cause the death of the person killed or that of some other person, or where the offender intends to do to the person killed or to some other person some grievous harm.\n\nOn the other hand, manslaughter is defined in Section 317 as the unlawful killing of another person in such circumstances as not to constitute murder. This implies that manslaughter is a lesser offence than murder, and it is often characterized by a lack of intent to kill or a mitigating circumstance that reduces the culpability of the offender.\n\nIn particular, Section 318 of the Criminal Code provides that when a person who unlawfully kills another is guilty of an offence which is called manslaughter if the killing was done in the heat of passion, and before there is time for the passion to cool. This suggests that manslaughter may be applicable in situations where the killing was not premeditated or intentional, but was rather a spontaneous reaction to a provocation.\n\nIn summary, the key differences between murder and manslaughter are:\n\n1. Intent: Murder requires an intent to kill or cause grievous harm, while manslaughter does not.\n2.

The general elements of theft are as follows:\n\n1. The accused must have taken something that belongs to another person.\n2. The thing taken must be capable of being stolen, such as money, goods, or property.\n3. The accused must have taken the thing with the intention of permanently depriving the owner of it.\n4. The accused must have taken the thing without the owner's consent.\n\nIn addition to these general elements, the Criminal Code provides for specific types of theft, such as stealing by clerks and servants (section 390(6)), stealing by agents and others (section 390(8)(b)), and stealing property of a certain value (section 390(9)).\n\nThe punishment for theft under the Criminal Code varies depending on the circumstances of the offence. For example, section 390(6) provides that a clerk or servant who steals property belonging to their employer is liable to imprisonment for seven years. Section 390(8)(b) provides that an agent or other person who steals property received by them for and on account of another person is liable to imprisonment for seven years.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Criminal Code also provides for offences analogous to stealing, such as concealing registers (section 391) and concealing wills (section 392).

This is provided for in Section 402(2)(a) of the Criminal Code.\n\nTo constitute armed robbery, the following elements must be present:\n1. The commission of the offence of robbery, which is defined in Section 402 of the Criminal Code as stealing anything with intent to permanently deprive the owner of the thing stolen, and at or immediately before or immediately after the time of stealing the thing, using or threatening to use actual violence to any person or property for the purpose of obtaining or retaining the thing stolen or to prevent or overcome resistance to its being stolen or retained.\n2. The offender must be armed with any firearms or any offensive weapon or any obnoxious or chemical materials, or must be in company with any person so armed.\n\nThe punishment for armed robbery under Nigerian law is imprisonment for not less than 21 years, as provided for in Section 402(1) of the Criminal Code. If the offender is armed with any firearms and with such firearms causes injury to an officer, the punishment is imprisonment for life, as provided for in Section 165(2) of the Criminal Code.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Nigerian law takes a serious view of armed robbery and prescribes severe punishments for offenders.

The act or omission must be an offence under the laws in force in the place where it is proposed to be done.\n\nThe Evidence Act, sections 8 and 9, also provide for the admissibility of evidence in conspiracy cases, including statements made by individual conspirators and acts or statements deemed to be relevant to prove the existence of the conspiracy.\n\nIn summary, conspiracy in criminal law is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a felony or an offence, with the intention to carry out the act or omission, and is punishable under the Criminal Code and the Evidence Act. \n\nAuthority: \n- Criminal Code, Chapter 54, sections 516 to 518A\n- Evidence Act, sections 8 and 9.", "created_at": "2026-01-17T17:52:47.510749+00:00", "latency_s": 1.7005362510681152, "context": "\n511.  Punishment of attempts to commit simple offences.  \n512.  Reduction of punishment.  \n513.  Attempts to procure commission of criminal acts.  \n514.  Prepara\ntion to commit crimes with explosives, etc.  \n515.  Neglect to prevent felony.  \nCHAPTER 54 \nConspiracy \n516.     Conspiracy to commit felony.  \n516A. Conspiracy to commit felony against law of a State.  \n517.     Conspiracy to commit offence.  \n517 A. Conspiracy to commit offence against law of a State.  \n518.     Other conspiracies.  \n518A.   Conspiracy in trade dispute\n.  \nCHAPTER 55 \nAccessories after the fact \n519.  Accessories after the fact to felonies\n\nA. Conspiracy to commit fel ony  against law of a State  \n  (1) Any person who while in a State conspires with another to do any act not in the State which \nif done in the State would be a felony against the law of the State and which is an offence against the \nlaw of the pla ce  where it is proposed to be done, is guilty of a felony and is liable, if no other \npunishment is provided, to imprisonment for seven years, or, if the greatest punishment to which a \nperson convicted of the felony in question is liable is less than imprisonment for seven years, the n to \nsuch lesser \n\n  \nCHAPTER 54 \nConspiracy \n516. Conspiracy to commit felony  \nAny person wh\no conspires with another to commit any felony, or to do any act in any part of the world \nwhich if done in Nigeria would be a felony, and which is an offence under the laws in force in the place \nwhere it is proposed to be done, is guilty of a felony and is liabl e, if no other punishment is provided, to \nimprisonment for seven years, or, if the greatest punishment to which a person convicted of the felony \nin question is liable is less than imprisonment for seven years, then to such lesser punishment.  \n516\n\npunishment.  \n  (2) In this section and section 517 A of this Code, \"law of a State\" has the meaning assigned to it \nin section l0A of this Code.  \n517. Conspiracy to commit offence  \nAny person who conspires with another to commit any offence which is not a felony, or to do any act in \nany part of the world, which if done in Nigeria would be an offence but not a felony, and which is an \noffence under the laws in force in the pl ace  where it is proposed to be done, is guilty of a misdemeanor \nand is liable to imprisonment for two years.  \n  The offender\n\n\nretercncc III common\nintention\n\npersons believed 10 be so conspiring, for the purpose of proving the existence of the\nconspiracy as well as [or the purpose of showing that any such person was a party to it.\n(2) Notwithstanding subsection (I) of this section, statements made by individual conspirators\nas to measures taken in the execution or furtherance of such common intention are not deemed\nto he relevant as such as against any conspirator, except those by whom or in whose presence\nsuch statements arc made.\n(J!

According to Section 28 of the Act, a person is not criminally responsible for an act or omission if, at the time of doing the act or making the omission, he was insane, so as not to be responsible for his actions.\n\nTo establish the defence of insanity, the accused must show that, at the time of the alleged offence, he was suffering from a defect of reason, arising from a disease of the mind, such that he did not know the nature and quality of his actions, or, if he did know, he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.\n\nThe burden of proving insanity lies on the accused, and the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities. If the defence of insanity is successfully raised, the accused may be found not guilty by reason of insanity, and may be subject to an order for his detention in a mental hospital or other suitable institution.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the defence of insanity is not limited to cases where the accused is completely devoid of reason, but may also be available in cases where the accused's mental faculties are impaired, but not completely destroyed.\n\nRELEVANT AUTHORITY:\n- Section 28 of the Criminal Code Act, Cap C38, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004.\n- Section 233 of the Evidence Act, Cap E14, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004.\n- The case of Director of Public Prosecutions v.

{"id": "Q021", "question": "What legal remedies are available for unlawful arrest?", "model_answer": "LEGAL REMEDIES FOR UNLAWFUL ARREST\n\nUnder Nigerian law, a person who has been unlawfully arrested has several legal remedies available to them. The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) provides for the fundamental rights of individuals, including the right to personal liberty.\n\n1. Habeas Corpus: This is a writ that can be brought before a court to challenge the legality of a person's detention. According to the Constitution, a person who is unlawfully detained can apply to a court for a writ of habeas corpus, which can order the person's release if the detention is found to be unlawful (Section 32 of the Constitution).\n\n2. Bail: If a person is arrested without a warrant, they can be released on bail by the police officer in charge of the station, subject to certain conditions (Section 30 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015).\n\n3. Fundamental Rights Enforcement: A person who has been unlawfully arrested can also bring an action to enforce their fundamental rights under the Constitution, including the right to personal liberty, freedom from torture, and the right to a fair hearing (Chapter IV of the Constitution).\n\n4. Civil Action for Damages: A person who has been unlawfully arrested can also bring a civil action for damages against the person or authority responsible for the arrest (Section 35 of the Constitution).\n\n5. Complaint to the Police: A person who has been unlawfully arrested can also make a complaint to the police, which can lead to an investigation and possible disciplinary action against the officer responsible for the arrest (Section 29 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015).\n\nIn conclusion, Nigerian law provides several legal remedies for unlawful arrest, including habeas corpus, bail, fundamental rights enforcement, civil action for damages, and complaint to the police. These remedies are designed to protect the fundamental rights of individuals and ensure that those responsible for unlawful arrests are held accountable.\n\nAuthorities:\n- Section 32 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended)\n- Section 30 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015\n- Chapter IV of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended)\n- Section 35 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended)\n- Section 29 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015", "created_at": "2026-01-17T17:53:04.104385+00:00", "latency_s": 1.8937082290649414, "context": "directions of any other person.  \nBail on arrest without warrant \n17. Release on bail of a person arrested without warrant  \nWhen any person has been taken into custody without a warrant for an offence other than an offence \npunishable wi\nth death, any officer in charge of a police station may, in any case, and shall, if it will not \nbe practicable to bring such person before a magistrate or justice of the peace having jurisdiction with \nrespect to the offence charged within 24 hours after he was so tak en into custody, inquire into the case, \nand, unless the offence appears to such officer to be of a serious\n\n. \n \nQuarterly report of \narrests to the \nAttorney-General. \n \n30.

A private company is required to restrict the transfer of its shares and may provide for certain conditions such as the requirement for the consent of all members for the sale of assets having a value of more than 50% of the total value of the company's assets, and the requirement for a member to offer their shares to existing members before selling to a non-member, as stated in section 22(2) of the Act.\n\nOn the other hand, a public company is any company other than a private company, as provided in section 24 of the Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020. The memorandum of association of a public company must state that it is a public company.\n\nSome key differences between private and public companies include:\n\n1. **Restriction on transfer of shares**: Private companies are required to restrict the transfer of their shares, while public companies are not subject to this restriction.\n2. **Number of members**: The total number of members of a private company shall not exceed 50, not including persons who are bona fide in the employment of the company, as provided in section 22(3) of the Act.\n3. **Invitation to the public**: A private company shall not, unless authorised by law, invite the public to subscribe for any share or debenture of the company, or deposit money for fixed periods or payable at call, as stated in section 22(5) of the Act.\n\nIn summary, the main difference between a private and public company lies in their structure, membership, and ability to invite the public to subscribe for shares or deposit money. \n\nRelevant authorities:\n- Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020, section 22\n- Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020, section 24", "created_at": "2026-01-17T17:53:44.039318+00:00", "latency_s": 2.010845422744751, "context": "to as “an unlimited company”).\n(2) A company of any of these types may either be a private company or\na public company.\n22.—(1) Private company is one which is stated in its memorandum of\nassociation to be a private company.\n(2) Subject to the provisions of the articles, a private company may\nrestrict the transfer of its shares and also provide that—\n(a) the company shall not, without the consent of all its members, sell\nassets having a value of more than 50% of the total value of the company’s\nassets ;\n(b) a member shall not sell that member’s shares in the company to a\nnon-member, without first offering those shares to existing members ; and\nCapacity of\nindividual to\nform\ncompany.\nTypes of\ncompanies.\nPrivate\ncompany.\n2020 No. 3          A 41Companies and Allied Matters Act , 2020\n(c) a member, or a group of members acting together, shall not sell or\nagree to sell more than 50% of the shares in the company to a person who\nis not then a member, unless that non-member has offered to buy all the\nexisting members’ interests on the same terms.\n(3)\n\n the failure to comply with the provisions of section\n22 of this Act was accidental or due to inadvertence or to some other sufficient\ncause or that on other grounds it is just and equitable to grant relief, the court\nmay, on such terms and conditions as may seem to be just and expedient,\norder that the company be relieved from the consequences mentioned in\nsubsection (1).\n24.

Section 22(2) of the Act provides that a private company may restrict the transfer of its shares and also provide that a member shall not sell that member's shares in the company to a non-member, without first offering those shares to existing members.\n\nFurthermore, Section 151(1) of the Act states that the transfer of a company's shares shall be by instrument of transfer and except as expressly provided in the articles, transfer of shares shall be without restrictions. However, Section 175(1) of the Act also provides that the transfer of a company's shares shall be by instrument of transfer and except as expressly provided in the articles, transfer of shares shall be without restrictions.\n\nIn a private company, the articles of association may impose restrictions on the transfer of shares. Therefore, whether shares can be transferred freely in a private company depends on the provisions of the company's articles of association. If the articles impose restrictions on the transfer of shares, then shares cannot be transferred freely.

However, the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) 2020, which applies to all companies in Nigeria, including banks, provides for the duties of directors.\n\nAccording to Section 279 of the CAMA 2020, a director of a company, including a bank, stands in a fiduciary relationship towards the company and shall observe the utmost good faith towards the company in any transaction with it or on its behalf. A director shall also owe a fiduciary relationship with the company in certain circumstances, including where a director is acting as an agent of a particular shareholder or where a shareholder or other person is dealing with the company's securities.\n\nFurthermore, Section 279(3) of the CAMA 2020 provides that a director shall act at all times in what he believes to be the best interest of the company. This implies that bank directors have a duty to act in the best interest of the bank and its shareholders, and to observe the utmost good faith in all their dealings with the bank.\n\nIn addition, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) may also issue guidelines and regulations that outline the duties and responsibilities of bank directors. These guidelines may include requirements for bank directors to ensure the bank's safety and soundness, to comply with regulatory requirements, and to act with integrity and transparency.\n\nIn summary, the duties of bank directors under BOFIA 2020 are not explicitly stated, but are governed by the provisions of the CAMA 2020 and any guidelines or regulations issued by the CBN. The duties include acting in the best interest of the bank, observing the utmost good faith, and complying with regulatory requirements. \n\nRelevant authority: \n- Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020, Section 279.\n- Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act, 2020.", "created_at": "2026-01-17T17:54:20.825920+00:00", "latency_s": 1.5536270141601562, "context": " and appoint~  \n(i) a new board of directors; or  \n(ii) a sole administrator,  \nto manage the affairs of the public enterprise;  \n (b)  direct the Commission to->  \n(i)   recover any debt being owed to the public enterprise;  \n (ii)  remove from office any officer or director who contributed to any of the  \nmatters revealed under subsection (4) of this section;  \n(iii) wind up the activities of the public enterprise and transfer its assets and  \nliabilities to such other body or bodies as he may determine;  \n(iv) take such other action as he may specify in the order.  \n \nPART VIII  \nDuties of directors. etc.  \n42.

{"id": "Q047", "question": "Can a bank freeze a customer’s account?", "model_answer": "ACCOUNT FREEZING UNDER NIGERIAN LAW\n\nThe question of whether a bank can freeze a customer's account is addressed under various Nigerian laws and regulations. \n\n1. The Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA) defines a bank and includes financial institutions, development banks, and mortgage banks established by law.\n2. Section 48 of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Act, 2004, provides that the Chairman of the Commission or any other authorized person may apply to the Court ex parte for power to issue an order to freeze an account.\n3. The EFCC Act also provides that the Court may make an order of revocation or confirmation of an interim order made pursuant to the Act, whichever order is considered just, appropriate, or reasonable within the circumstances.\n\nUnder Nigerian law, a bank can freeze a customer's account in certain circumstances, such as:\n- where the account is suspected to be used for money laundering or other financial crimes, as provided under the EFCC Act and the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011 (as amended);\n- where the bank is required to do so by a court order or an order from a regulatory authority, such as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) or the EFCC;\n- where the bank has reasonable grounds to believe that the account is being used for fraudulent or other unlawful activities.\n\nIn such cases, the bank may be required to freeze the account pending investigation or court proceedings. However, the bank must comply with the relevant laws and regulations, including the EFCC Act, BOFIA, and the CBN guidelines on account freezing.\n\nRelevant authorities:\n- Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Act, 2004\n- Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA)\n- Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011 (as amended)\n- Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) guidelines on account freezing.", "created_at": "2026-01-17T17:54:30.999735+00:00", "latency_s": 1.9580798149108887, "context": ", where any  \nperson is arrested under this Act, the Executive Secretary of the Agency may, if he is  \nsatisfied that the money in the account of an arrested person is made through the commission  \nof an offence under this Act, apply to the Federal High Court exparte for power to  \nissue or instruct a bank examiner or such other appropriate regulatory authority to issue  \norder as specified in Form 2 of the Second Schedule to this Act, addressed to the manager  \nof the bank or any person in control of the financial institution where the account is or is  \nbelieved by him to be at the head office of the bank or other financial institution to  \nfreeze the account.  \n[Second Schedule]  \n(2) The Executive Secretary of the Agency or bank examiner may by an order issued  \nunder subsection (1)  of this section, or by any subsequent order, direct the bank or other  \nfinancial institution to supply any information and produce books and documents relating  \nto the account and to stop all outward payments, operations or transactions (including any  \nbill of exchange) in respect of the account of the arrested person.  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n(3) The manager or any other person in control of the financial institution shall take  \nnecessary steps to comply with the requirements\n\n a person \nis made through the commission of an offence under this Act and/or any of the enactments specified \nunder section 7 (2) (a) to (f) of this Act, apply to the Court ex parte for power to issue an order as \nspecified in Form B of the Schedule to this Act, addressed to the manager of the bank or any person in \ncontrol of the financial institution or designated non‐financial institution where the account is or \nbelieved by him to be or the head office of the bank, other financial institution or designated non‐\nfinancial institution to freeze the account.  \n[Schedule.] \n  (2) The Chairman of the Commission, or any other authorised by \n\n.  \n21. Special provisions as to client acconnts with banks  \n(1) A bank at which a legal practitioner keeps an account for clients' moneys shall  \nnot, in respect of any liability of the legal practitioner to the bank which does not arise in  \nconnection with that account, have or obtain any recourse or right, whether by way of set‐  \noff, counter‐claim, charge or otherwise, against moneys standing to the credit of that ac‐  \ncount.  \n(2) A bank shall not, in connection with any transaction in respect of an account of a  \nlegal practitioner kept for clients' moneys with that or with any other bank (other\n\n a Receiver or Liquidator of a failed bank for the recovery of a debt \nowed to the failed bank;  \n\"bank\" has the meaning assigned to it under the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act and includes‐  \n      [Cap. m.]  \n  (a)   a financial institution as defined under that Act or under the Nigerian Deposit    \n  Insurance Corporation Act; and  \n       [Cap. N102.]  \n  (b)   a development bank; and  \n  (c)   a mortgage bank or any other bank established by law;  \n       [1995 No. 18.]  \n\"Court\" means the Federal High Court;  \n  \n\"debt\" means any loan, advance, credit accommodation, guarantee or any\n\n control of the head office or branch of a bank or other  \nfinancial institution who fails to pay over to the Agency upon the production to him of a  \nfinal order commits an offence under this Act and is liable on conviction to imprisonment  \nfor a term of not less than one year and not more than three years, without the option of a  \nfine.  \n[2005 No. 28.]  \n47.

According to Section 29 of the Evidence Act, a confession made by a defendant may be rejected if it was obtained by oppression of the person who made it, or in consequence of anything said or done which was likely to render unreliable any confession which might be made by him. \n\nFurthermore, Section 28 of the Evidence Act provides that a confession caused by inducement, threat or promise is irrelevant in criminal proceedings. Additionally, a confession made under a promise of secrecy, or in consequence of a deception practised on the accused person for the purpose of obtaining it, or when he was drunk, or because it was made in answer to questions which he need not have answered, may also be rejected.\n\nThe court has the discretion to reject a confessional statement if it is of the opinion that the confession was not made voluntarily, or if it was obtained under circumstances that render it unreliable. This is in line with the provisions of Section 29 of the Evidence Act, which requires the court to exclude a confession if it is represented to the court that the confession was or may have been obtained by oppression or in consequence of anything said or done which was likely to render unreliable any confession which might be made by the defendant. \n\nIn the case of R v. Igwe (1960) NRNLR 155, the court held that a confession obtained by oppression or under circumstances that render it unreliable is inadmissible. Similarly, in the case of Onafowokan v. The State (1987) 3 NWLR (Part 61) 538, the court held that a confession made under duress or coercion is not admissible as evidence. \n\nIn conclusion, confessional statements can be rejected if they were obtained under circumstances that render them unreliable or if they were made under duress, coercion or oppression.

{"id": "Q063", "question": "What is the difference between trial and appellate courts?", "model_answer": "DISTINCTION BETWEEN TRIAL AND APPELLATE COURTS\n\nThe distinction between trial and appellate courts is a fundamental concept in the Nigerian judicial system. The primary difference between the two lies in their functions and the nature of proceedings conducted before them.\n\nTrial courts, such as the Magistrate Court or the High Court, are courts of first instance where cases are initially heard and determined. Section 241 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015, provides that trials shall be held in the Magistrate Court or any other court or tribunal exercising criminal jurisdiction. The primary function of trial courts is to receive evidence, determine facts, and apply the law to the facts of a case to arrive at a judgment or verdict.\n\nOn the other hand, appellate courts, such as the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, are courts of review that hear appeals from decisions of lower courts. Section 241 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), provides that an appeal shall lie from decisions of the Federal High Court or a High Court to the Court of Appeal as of right in certain cases. The primary function of appellate courts is to review decisions of lower courts for errors of law or fact, and to correct any injustices that may have occurred during the trial.\n\nIn summary, the key differences between trial and appellate courts are:\n\n1. **Function**: Trial courts determine cases at first instance, while appellate courts review decisions of lower courts.\n2. **Proceedings**: Trial courts receive evidence and determine facts, while appellate courts review records of proceedings from lower courts.\n3. **Jurisdiction**: Trial courts have original jurisdiction over cases, while appellate courts have appellate jurisdiction over decisions of lower courts.\n\nRelevant authorities:\n- Section 241 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015\n- Section 241 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended)\n- Section 28 of the Supreme Court Act, 1990 (as amended)", "created_at": "2026-01-17T17:55:16.607987+00:00", "latency_s": 1.983938217163086, "context": " the State or a law officer in his office; \n \n(c) by a Legal Officer of any prosecuting agency; \n \n(d) by a private prosecutor; or \n \n(e) summarily, in accordance with the provisions of this Act. \n \n(2) Trials shall be held in the Magistrate Court or any other court or tribunal exercising \ncriminal jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of this Act relating to \nsummary trials. \n \nTrials. \n \n \n \n349.

{"id": "Q066", "question": "What is locus standi?", "model_answer": "LOCUS STANDI\nLocus standi refers to the right or capacity of a person to bring an action or to be heard in a court of law. In Nigerian law, the concept of locus standi is governed by the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, as amended, and various statutes.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court in the case of Attorney-General of Abia State v. Attorney-General of the Federation (2002) 6 NWLR (Pt. 764) 542, locus standi means the right to institute an action in a court of law. The court held that a plaintiff must have a sufficient interest in the subject matter of the litigation to justify the court's exercise of jurisdiction.\n\nIn order to establish locus standi, a plaintiff must show that he has a direct and personal interest in the matter being litigated, and that he is not a mere busybody or meddlesome interloper. The plaintiff must also demonstrate that he has suffered or is likely to suffer a specific injury or harm as a result of the defendant's actions or inactions.\n\nThe Nigerian courts have consistently held that locus standi is a fundamental requirement for the institution of an action in court. In the case of Chief Gani Fawehinmi v. Nigerian Bar Association (1987) 4 NWLR (Pt. 67) 1, the Court of Appeal held that locus standi is a threshold issue that must be resolved in favour of the plaintiff before the court can proceed to consider the merits of the case.\n\nIn conclusion, locus standi is a critical concept in Nigerian law that determines whether a person has the right to bring an action or to be heard in a court of law.

{"id": "Q067", "question": "What is the effect of limitation of actions?", "model_answer": "LIMITATION OF ACTIONS\n\nThe effect of limitation of actions is to bar a claimant from bringing an action against a defendant after a certain period of time has elapsed. In Nigeria, the Limitation Law of the various states and the Limitation Act of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, provide for the time limits within which certain actions must be brought.\n\nAccording to the provisions of the Limitation Law, if a claimant fails to bring an action within the prescribed time limit, the claim will be statute-barred, and the defendant will be entitled to plead the limitation period as a defense. This means that the claimant will be prevented from pursuing the claim, regardless of its merits.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the court may grant an extension of time in certain circumstances, as provided for in the rules of court.

According to the NJC Guidelines for Virtual Court Sittings, 2020, courts in Nigeria can sit virtually. The guidelines provide a framework for the conduct of virtual court proceedings, including the use of technology, security measures, and the protection of sensitive information.\n\nFurthermore, the Chief Justice of Nigeria has also issued Practice Directions to guide the conduct of virtual court proceedings. The Practice Directions provide for the use of video conferencing technology, online platforms, and other digital tools to facilitate virtual court sittings.\n\nIn addition, some courts in Nigeria have also made rules to regulate virtual court proceedings. For example, the Federal High Court of Nigeria (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2019, provide for the use of technology to facilitate virtual court sittings.\n\nIt is worth noting that while virtual court sittings are permitted in Nigeria, they are subject to certain conditions and guidelines. The courts must ensure that virtual proceedings are conducted in a manner that is fair, transparent, and secure.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the guidelines and rules issued by the NJC, the Chief Justice of Nigeria, and the courts, it can be stated that courts in Nigeria can sit virtually, subject to the provisions of the relevant guidelines and rules.\n\nAuthority:\n- National Judicial Council Guidelines for Virtual Court Sittings, 2020\n- Practice Directions issued by the Chief Justice of Nigeria\n- Federal High Court of Nigeria (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2019", "created_at": "2026-01-17T17:55:31.811929+00:00", "latency_s": 1.6692233085632324, "context": " of Nigeria but it shall not apply to ---\n(a) proceeding before an arbitrator:\n(b) a field general court martial: or\n(d) judicial proceeding in any civil cause or matter in or before any Sharia Court of\nAppeal, Customary Court of Appeal.

{"id": "Q071", "question": "What is the binding effect of Supreme Court decisions?", "model_answer": "BINDING EFFECT OF SUPREME COURT DECISIONS\n\nThe binding effect of Supreme Court decisions is a fundamental principle in the Nigerian legal system. According to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the Supreme Court is the highest court in the land, and its decisions are binding on all other courts.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decisions have the same force and effect as if all the Justices who heard the case were present in court and had declared their opinions in person, as provided in Section 12 of the Supreme Court Act. This means that the judgment of the court is final and binding on the parties to the case, and it is also binding on all lower courts in Nigeria.\n\nFurthermore, the Supreme Court has the power to determine the real question in controversy in an appeal, and its decisions on such matters are binding on all parties, as provided in Section 22 of the Supreme Court Act.

{"id": "Q072", "question": "Can the Supreme Court overrule itself?", "model_answer": "LEGAL POSITION\nThe Supreme Court, as the highest court in Nigeria, has the final say on matters of law. However, the question of whether the Supreme Court can overrule itself is not directly addressed in the Constitution or the Supreme Court Act.\n\nRELEVANT AUTHORITY\nSection 235 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) provides that the Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other court to hear and determine appeals from the Court of Appeal. However, it does not explicitly state whether the Supreme Court can overrule its previous decisions.\n\nCASE LAW\nIn the case of Adegoke Motors Ltd. v. Adesanya (1989) 3 NWLR (Pt. 109) 250, the Supreme Court held that it is not bound by its previous decisions and can overrule them if it considers it necessary to do so in the interest of justice. This decision suggests that the Supreme Court has the power to overrule its previous decisions, although it is not a common practice.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, while there is no explicit provision in the Constitution or the Supreme Court Act that allows the Supreme Court to overrule itself, the court has held in a previous decision that it has the power to do so in the interest of justice. Therefore, it can be argued that the Supreme Court can overrule itself, but this power is exercised sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances.\n\nCITATION\nAdegoke Motors Ltd. v.

{"id": "Q073", "question": "What is ratio decidendi?", "model_answer": "INTRODUCTION\nThe concept of ratio decidendi is a fundamental principle in the Nigerian legal system, particularly in the realm of judicial precedent. \n\nDEFINITION OF RATIO DECIDENDI\nRatio decidendi refers to the reason or principle of law that determines the outcome of a case. It is the core or essential reasoning that underlies a judicial decision, and it is this reasoning that is binding on lower courts in subsequent cases. \n\nAPPLICATION OF RATIO DECIDENDI\nIn Nigerian law, the ratio decidendi of a case is the principle of law that is essential to the decision reached by the court. It is the legal principle that is applied to the facts of the case to arrive at the judgment. The ratio decidendi is distinguishable from obiter dicta, which are statements made by the court that are not essential to the decision.\n\nAUTHORITY\nThe concept of ratio decidendi is supported by various Nigerian cases, including the case of Adebayo v. Abidogun (2008) 18 NWLR (Pt. 1119) 1, where the Court of Appeal held that the ratio decidendi of a case is the principle of law that is essential to the decision reached by the court.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, the ratio decidendi is a crucial concept in Nigerian law, as it represents the underlying principle of law that determines the outcome of a case. It is essential for legal practitioners and judges to identify the ratio decidendi of a case in order to apply the correct principle of law in subsequent cases.", "created_at": "2026-01-17T17:55:47.199716+00:00", "latency_s": 1.519869089126587, "context": "the rate of which is expressed by reference to a specified quantity of \nany goods, shall be chargeable or allowable on any fraction of that quantity of goods and the amount \npayable or allowable on any such fractio n  shall be calculated proportionally:  \nProvided that the Board may determine the fractions to be taken into account of any quantity.  \n  (2) In all final calculations of duties, rents, drawbacks and other charges, fractions of a kobo shall \nbe disregarded.  \nPART XI \nGeneral \nGeneral powers, agents, etc. \n144. Bond and security  \n  (1) Without p\nrejudice to any express requirement as to security contained in the customs or \n\n\n t,  any special resolution of a company increasing the \nnumber of shares of any class, may validly resolve that any existing class of preference shares shall carry the right \nto such votes additional to one vote per share as shall be necessary in order to preserve the existing ratio which \nthe votes exer\ncisable by the holders of such preference shares at a general meeting of the company bear to the \ntotal votes exercisable at the meeting.  \n(3) For the purposes of subsection (2) of this section, a dividend shall be deemed to be due on the date appointed \nin the articles for the payment of the dividend for any year or other period, or if no\n\n) above  .................................... 2500.00  \n(iv) Modification of approved pattern .................................................................

{"id": "Q076", "question": "What happens when courts give conflicting judgments?", "model_answer": "CONFLICTING JUDGMENTS\n\nWhen courts give conflicting judgments, the law provides for a mechanism to resolve such conflicts. According to the principles of res judicata, a final judgment, order, or decree of a competent court is relevant in determining whether a court ought to take cognizance of a suit or hold a trial. \n\nIn Nigeria, the principle of res judicata is provided for in the Evidence Act, which states that a final judgment, order, or decree of a competent court is relevant in determining whether a court ought to take cognizance of a suit or hold a trial. \n\nSection 16 of the Evidence Act provides that the existence of any judgment, order, or decree which by law prevents any court from taking cognizance of a suit or holding a trial is a relevant fact when the question is whether such court ought to take cognizance of such suit or to hold such trial.\n\nFurthermore, Section 50 of the Evidence Act provides that a final judgment, order, or decree of a competent court in the same jurisdiction is relevant in determining the rights of the parties.\n\nIn the case of conflicting judgments, the court may consider the principle of res judicata and determine which judgment is binding on the parties. The court may also consider the doctrine of stare decisis, which requires that a court follow its previous decisions in similar cases.\n\nIn the case of cross judgments between the same parties for the payment of money, execution shall be taken out by that party only who shall have obtained a judgment for the larger sum, and for so much only as shall remain after deducting the smaller sum. \n\nIt is also worth noting that the Court of Appeal has the power to set aside or vary a judgment of a lower court, and the Supreme Court has the power to set aside or vary a judgment of the Court of Appeal. \n\nIn conclusion, when courts give conflicting judgments, the law provides for a mechanism to resolve such conflicts through the principles of res judicata, stare decisis, and the powers of the higher courts to set aside or vary judgments of lower courts. \n\nRelevant authorities include:\n- Evidence Act, Section 16\n- Evidence Act, Section 50\n- Court of Appeal Act, Section 16\n- Supreme Court Act, Section 22.", "created_at": "2026-01-17T17:55:56.015170+00:00", "latency_s": 1.8145809173583984, "context": "nature and effect of the statement, and of the circumstances in which it was made.  \n    Judgments  of courts of justice when relevant  \n49. Previous judgments relevant to bar a second suit or trial  \nThe existence of any judgment, order or decree which by law prevents any court from taking cognisance of a suit \nor holding a trial, is a relevant fact when the question is whether such court ought to take cognisance of such suit \nor to hold such trial.  \n______________________________ \n* See section 16. \n50. Relevancy of certain judgments in certain jurisdiction  \n  (1) A final judgment, order or decree of a competent court, in the\n\n-  \nsires to issue a judgment summons in a court other than that in which the judgment was  \ngiven, or the judgment was given in a magi strate's court and the judgment creditor de-  \nsires to issue in the High Court any process affecti ng the immovable property of the  \njudgment debtor which may not lawfully issue out of a magi strate's court, the judgment  \ncreditor may apply to the court in which the judgment was given for the transfer of the  \nproceedings subsequent to judgment to a court having jurisdiction to issue the judgment  \nsummons or process against immovable property.  \n(2) The application may be made in like manner and form as an applicati on by a  \nparty to a cause or matter for a transfer thereof before judgment.  \n(3) Upon such application, all or any of the proceedings subsequent to judgment may  \nbe transferred to the court to which transfer is requested, in the manner, and upon the  \nsame conditions upon which, and with the same effect with which, the cause or matter in  \nwhich the judgment was given might have been transferred to that court before judgment.  \n(4) When the proceedings have been transferred to the other court, payments under  \nthe judgment\n\nutory order,  \nthe court may, if it thinks fit, stay further proceedings in the suit until the order  \nis fulfilled, or may give a judgment or non-suit against such plaintiff, with or  \nwithout liberty of bringi ng any other suit on the same grounds of action, or  \nmay make such other order on such terms as to the court shall seem just;  \n (b)  if a defendant in any suit makes such default or failure the court may give  \njudgment by default against such defendant, or make such other order as to the  \ncourt may seem just; but any such judgment by default may be set aside by the  \ncourt upon such terms as to the costs or otherwise as the court may think fit.  \n13.

This implies that the Supreme Court has the power to review its own decisions in certain circumstances.\n\nFurthermore, the Supreme Court has inherent jurisdiction to review its own decisions where there has been a miscarriage of justice or where the decision was made in error.

{"id": "Q078", "question": "What is judicial precedent?", "model_answer": "JUDICIAL PRECEDENT\n\nJudicial precedent refers to the principle that a decision made by a court in a previous case is binding on a lower court in a subsequent case with similar facts and issues. This principle is based on the doctrine of stare decisis, which means \"to stand by things decided\".\n\nIn Nigeria, the doctrine of judicial precedent is recognized and applied by the courts. The Supreme Court, being the highest court in the land, has the final say on matters of law and its decisions are binding on all lower courts. The Court of Appeal, Federal High Court, and other lower courts are bound to follow the decisions of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal in similar cases.\n\nThe relevance of judicial precedent is highlighted in Section 49 of the Evidence Act, which provides that previous judgments are relevant to bar a second suit or trial. Additionally, Section 50 of the Evidence Act provides that a final judgment, order, or decree of a competent court is relevant in certain jurisdictions.\n\nThe judicial precedent is also supported by the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which establishes the hierarchy of courts and the principle of stare decisis. The Constitution provides that the Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other court to hear and determine appeals from the Court of Appeal (Section 233 of the Constitution).\n\nIn summary, judicial precedent is a fundamental principle of the Nigerian legal system, which ensures consistency, predictability, and fairness in the application of the law.

{"id": "Q080", "question": "Can customary law override statutory law?", "model_answer": "CUSTOMARY LAW AND STATUTORY LAW\n\nUnder Nigerian law, customary law can be administered by customary courts, but it is subject to certain limitations. According to Section 16 of the Federal Capital Territory Customary Court Act 2007, a customary court shall administer the appropriate customary law, but only in so far as it is not repugnant to natural justice, equity and good conscience nor incompatible either directly or by necessary implication with any written law for the time being in force.\n\nThis means that customary law cannot override statutory law. If there is a conflict between customary law and statutory law, the statutory law will prevail. This is because Section 16 of the Act specifically states that customary law must not be incompatible with any written law, which includes statutory law.\n\nFurthermore, Section 16 (b) of the Act states that a customary court may also administer the provisions of any written law which the court may be authorized to enforce by an order made pursuant to the provisions of this Act. This implies that statutory law takes precedence over customary law, and customary courts are required to apply statutory law where applicable.\n\nIn conclusion, customary law cannot override statutory law in Nigeria.

{"id": "Q087", "question": "Can a will override customary inheritance?", "model_answer": "CUSTOMARY INHERITANCE AND WILLS\n\nUnder Nigerian law, specifically the Federal Capital Territory Customary Court Act 2007, a customary law shall be deemed to be binding upon a person where that person is an indigene of a place in which the customary law is in force, or where the person agrees or is deemed to have agreed to be bound by the customary law. \n\nIn cases of claim under a customary law of inheritance, the customary law binding between the parties which appeared to have regulated the subject matter in dispute shall apply. However, the question of whether a will can override customary inheritance is not directly addressed in the Act.\n\nSection 18(1)(d) of the Act provides that a customary law shall be deemed to be binding upon a person who agrees or is deemed to have agreed to be bound by the customary law. This implies that a person may choose to be bound by a will, which may override customary inheritance.\n\nHowever, the Act does not provide a clear answer to this question. In the absence of specific provisions, it can be argued that a will may override customary inheritance if the testator has explicitly stated their intention to override customary law in the will.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the Wills Act, which is not cited in the provided text, may provide further guidance on this issue. Nevertheless, based on the Federal Capital Territory Customary Court Act 2007, it can be argued that a will may override customary inheritance if the testator has agreed to be bound by the will, and the will is validly made and executed.\n\nRelevant authority: \n- Federal Capital Territory Customary Court Act 2007, Section 18(1)(d)\n- Federal Capital Territory Customary Court Act 2007, Section 18(1) generally.", "created_at": "2026-01-17T17:56:25.311926+00:00", "latency_s": 1.821775197982788, "context": "  \nCourt to  \npromote  \nreconciliation. \n \n \nLaws to be \nadministered.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAppropriate  \nLand Law.  \n \n \n2007  No.8    Federal Capital Territory Customary Court Act  \n \n \nparty, the appropriate customary law shall be the customary law binding between  \nthe parties which appeared to have regulated the subject matter in dispute;  \n(b) in all other civil causes and matters the appropriate customary law to be  \nadministered shall be the customary law prevailing in the area of jurisdiction of the  \ncourt.  \n18 .-(1) A customary law shall be deemed to be binding upon a person where  \n       that person-  \n(a) is an indigene of a place in which the customary law is in force;  \n(b) being in a place in which the customary law is in force, does an act in  \nviolation of the customary law;  \n(c) in cases of claim under a customary law of inheritance, makes a claim in  \nrespect of the property or estate of a deceased person and the deceased person  \nwas an indigene of the place in which the customary law was in force;  \n     (d) agrees or is deemed to have agreed to\n\n be bound by the customary law.  \n   (2) In any matter relating to the guardianship of a child, the interest and welfare  \n    of the child shall be the first and paramount consideration.  \n(3) Whenever it appears to a customary court that an interim order made by  \n   such court in the interest of a child, be reviewed, the court may, of its own motion or  \n   upon the application of any interested person, vary or discharge such order.  \n(4) Where there is a contravention of any customary law, a customary Court  \n   may subject to the provisions of this Act impose a penalty authorised by or consistent  \n   with the customary law:  \nPROVIDED  that no such penalty shall involve mutilation, torture or other personal  \n  violence or be inhuman or repugnant to natural justice.  \n19 .-(1) Evidence of a customary law shall be adduced in a customary court in  \n  all such cases as may be provided in the rules made under this Act.  \n(2) No proceedings in a customary court and no summons, warrant, process,  \norder or decree issued or made thereby shall be varied or declared void upon appeal  \nsolely by reason of any defect in procedure or want\n\nof a document in \nquestion.  \n  (2) Any person other than a party to a document or his representative in interest may, notwithstanding \nthe existence of any document, prove any fact which he is otherwise entitled to prove.  \n  (3) Any party to any document or any representative in interest of any such party may prove any such fact \nfor any purpose other than that of varying or altering any right or liability depending upon the terms of the \ndocument.  \n  (4) Nothing in this Part contained shall be taken to affect any of the provisions of any enactment as to the \nconstruction of wills. \n         PART VII  \n    Production  and effect of e\n\n by the testator in the \npresence of, and is attested by, the master or first mate of the ship; and  \n (b)  if the will was not made on board the ship, to any person claiming under the  \nwill, who is not related to the testator by blood or marriage, unless the will is in writing and is \nsigned or acknowledged by the testator in the presence of, and is attested to by two witnesses, \none of whom shall be the superintendent or a person holding a similar office or a minister of \nreligion officiating in the place in which the will is made or where there are no such persons, \na magistrate, notary public or consular officer of a foreign country or an officer of customs.  \n(2) Whenever the superintendent refuses under this section to payor deliver the resi-  \ndue to a person claiming under a will, the residue shall be dealt with as if no will had  \nbeen made.  \n173.

The law provides for the distribution of the deceased person's estate among their relatives.\n\nAccording to the Administration of Estates Law, the estate of the deceased person will be distributed as follows:\n- The spouse and children of the deceased person will inherit the estate in equal shares, with the spouse taking one-third of the estate and the children taking two-thirds.\n- If the deceased person has no spouse or children, the estate will be distributed among their parents, brothers, and sisters.\n- If the deceased person has no relatives, the estate will escheat to the state.\n\nThe relevant authority for this is the Administration of Estates Law, which varies by state in Nigeria. For example, in Lagos State, the relevant law is the Administration of Estates Law, Cap A2, Laws of Lagos State, 2003. \n\nIn general, the law provides that the estate of a person who dies intestate shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the law, which sets out the order of priority for the distribution of the estate among the deceased person's relatives. \n\nIt is worth noting that the specific provisions of the Administration of Estates Law may vary from state to state in Nigeria, and the distribution of the estate will depend on the specific circumstances of the case and the applicable law.", "created_at": "2026-01-17T17:56:27.531232+00:00", "latency_s": 1.5236234664916992, "context": "child dies intestate, the unborn child is entitled, if he was \nconceived during the lifetime of his father, to be considered in the distribution of the estate of the \ndeceased father.  \n(3) Where the mother of an unborn child dies intestate before the child is de livered,  the unborn \nchild is entitled, if he survives his mother, to be considered in the distribution of the estate of the \ndeceased mother.  \n18.   Contractual rights of a child \n(1) No child shall enter into a contract, except as provided in this section.  \n(2) Any contract, except a contact for necessaries, entered into by a child for re payment of \nmoney\n\n by the testator in the \npresence of, and is attested by, the master or first mate of the ship; and  \n (b)  if the will was not made on board the ship, to any person claiming under the  \nwill, who is not related to the testator by blood or marriage, unless the will is in writing and is \nsigned or acknowledged by the testator in the presence of, and is attested to by two witnesses, \none of whom shall be the superintendent or a person holding a similar office or a minister of \nreligion officiating in the place in which the will is made or where there are no such persons, \na magistrate, notary public or consular officer of a foreign country or an officer of customs.  \n(2) Whenever the superintendent refuses under this section to payor deliver the resi-  \ndue to a person claiming under a will, the residue shall be dealt with as if no will had  \nbeen made.  \n173.

{"id": "Q089", "question": "What is the legal status of adoption in Nigeria?", "model_answer": "LEGAL STATUS OF ADOPTION IN NIGERIA\n\nThe legal status of adoption in Nigeria is governed by the Adoption Act. According to the Act, adoption is a legal process where a person takes on the role of a parent to a child, with all the rights and responsibilities that come with it.\n\nRECOGNITION OF ADOPTION\nThe Adoption Act recognizes adoption orders made under the Act, as well as adoptions made under the law of any other country, provided that the adoption is in the best interest of the child. Section 146 of the Act states that an adoption made under any law in force in any part of Nigeria, or under the law of any other country, shall have the same validity and effect as if the adoption had been made by an adoption order under the Act.\n\nRESTRICTIONS ON ADOPTION\nThe Act imposes certain restrictions on adoption, including the requirement that the adoption must be in the best interest of the child. Section 144 of the Act prohibits the removal of a child from one state to another, or from Nigeria to another country, for the purpose of adoption, except under a license issued by the Minister. Section 147 of the Act also prohibits the marriage between an adopted parent and the adopted child.\n\nJURISDICTION OF THE COURT\nThe Court has exclusive jurisdiction to deal with adoption matters, and the Chief Justice of Nigeria has the power to make rules of court for regulating the practice and procedure of the Court in respect of adoption. Section 136 of the Act states that the Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to deal with an application for an adoption order, while section 137 of the Act empowers the Chief Justice to make rules of court for regulating the practice and procedure of the Court in respect of adoption.\n\nIn conclusion, the legal status of adoption in Nigeria is governed by the Adoption Act, which recognizes adoption orders made under the Act, as well as adoptions made under the law of any other country.

{"id": "Q095", "question": "Can public officers be prosecuted after leaving office?", "model_answer": "PROSECUTION OF PUBLIC OFFICERS AFTER LEAVING OFFICE\n\nThe question of whether public officers can be prosecuted after leaving office is addressed in various provisions of the Nigerian law. \n\n1. The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria does not provide a general immunity for public officers after they leave office. \n2. Section 308 of the Constitution provides immunity for the President, Vice-President, Governors, and Deputy Governors while they are in office, but this immunity does not extend to them after they leave office.\n3. The Criminal Code, which applies to public officers, does not provide any immunity for public officers after they leave office.\n4. In fact, Section 98C of the Criminal Code specifically provides that a judicial officer cannot be arrested without warrant for an offence under sections 98, 98A, or 98B, but it does not provide any immunity from prosecution after leaving office.\n5. Furthermore, the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act, which regulates the conduct of public officers, provides that a public officer can be prosecuted for any breach of the code of conduct after leaving office.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the Nigerian law, public officers can be prosecuted after leaving office for any offences committed while they were in office. The relevant authorities, such as the Code of Conduct Bureau and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, can investigate and prosecute public officers after they leave office, provided that the offences were committed while they were in office and the prosecution is commenced within the relevant limitation period.\n\nRelevant authorities: \n- The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended)\n- The Criminal Code, Cap C38, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004\n- The Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act, Cap C15, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004", "created_at": "2026-01-17T17:56:45.347517+00:00", "latency_s": 1.7626097202301025, "context": " Nigeria.  \n     [Second  Schedule.]  \n8. Retired public officers  \nA public officer shall not, after his retirement from public service and while receiving pension from \npublic funds, accept more than one remunerative position as chairman, director or employee of a \ncompany owned or controlled by any Government or public authority or receive any other \nremuneration from public funds in addition to his pension and the emolument of one such remunerative \nposition.  \n9. Certain retired public officers  \n(1) Retired public officers who have held offices to which this section applies are prohibited from service \nor employment in foreign companies or foreign enterprises.  \n(2) This section \n\n felony and is liable to imprisonment for three years.  \nThe offender cannot be arrested without warrant.  \n108. Personating public officers            \n        Any person who‐  \n(1) personates any person employed in the public service on an occasion when the latter is required to \ndo any act or attend in any place by virtue of his employment; or  \n(2) falsely represents himself to be a person employed in the public service, and assumes to do any act \nor to attend in any place for the purpose of doing any act by virtue of such employment,  \nis guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for three years.\n\n public official in the discharge of his \nofficial duties or in relation to any such matter as aforesaid, \n  \n                is guilty of the felony of official corruption and is liable to imprisonment for \nseven years. \n  \n(2)           In any proceedings for an offence under this section it shall not be necessary to prove- \n 30  \n  \n(a)            that any public official counselled the commission of the offence; or \n  \n(b)            that in the course of committing the offence the accused mentioned any particular \npublic official; or \n  \n(c)            that (in a case to which subsection (1)(ii) is relevant) the accused believed that any \npublic official would do, make or show the act, omission, favour or disfavour in \nquestion; or \n  \n(d)            that the accused intended to give the property or benefit in question, or any part \nthereof, to a public official. \n  \n98C.

{"id": "Q100", "question": "Can corruption cases be settled out of court?", "model_answer": "CORRUPTION CASES UNDER NIGERIAN LAW\n\nThe legal position in Nigeria is that corruption cases cannot be settled out of court. According to Section 98 of the Criminal Code, a public official who corruptly asks for, receives, or obtains any property or benefit of any kind for himself or any other person is guilty of the felony of official corruption and is liable to imprisonment for seven years.\n\nFurthermore, Section 309 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015, provides that prosecution for an offence under the provisions of the Criminal Code shall not be commenced except by, or with the consent of, a law officer. This implies that corruption cases are to be prosecuted through the formal judicial process.\n\nAdditionally, Section 319 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015, provides that a court may order the defendant or convict to pay compensation to any person injured by the offence, but this is within the proceedings or while passing judgment, and not as a means of settling the case out of court.\n\nIn light of these provisions, it is clear that corruption cases under Nigerian law are to be prosecuted through the formal judicial process and cannot be settled out of court. Any attempt to settle such cases out of court would be contrary to the law and may be considered an obstruction of justice.\n\nAuthorities:\n- Section 98 of the Criminal Code\n- Section 309 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015\n- Section 319 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015", "created_at": "2026-01-17T17:56:57.896822+00:00", "latency_s": 1.4030790328979492, "context": "ever they may be  \n found within the .......................................................................Judicial Division/Magi sterial District  \n(except the wearing apparel and bedding of him or his family and the tool s and implements of his  \ntrade, to the value of ten naira), and also by seizing and taking any money, bank notes, cheques,  \nbills of exchange, promissory notes, bonds or securities for money belonging to the plaintiff which  \nmay there be found or such part or so much thereof as may be sufficient to sati sfy thi s executi on  \nand to bring what you shall have so levied into Court and to make return of what you have done  \nunder thi s writ immediately upon the execution thereof.  \n DATED thi s  ............................. day of  .............................................................................20  .......... .  \n.............................................   \n     Judge [or Magistrate]  \nTo the Sheriff and Bailiffs of the Court.  \n   \n N  K  \n Cost remaining due ................................................................................ .  \n Fees on issue of this writ  ...................................................................... .  \nTotal amount to be levied exclusive of further costs, if any, of  \nexecution ................................................................................................N  \n Applicati on was made to the registrar for this writ at  ..........  ..................................................... .  \n minutes past the\n\n corruptly asks for, receives or obtains any property or benefit of any kind for \nhimself or any other person; or bribes, etc., \n  \n(b)           corruptly agrees or attempts to receive or obtain any property or benefit of any kind \nfor himself or any other person, on account of- \n  \n(i)             anything already, done or omitted, or any favour or disfavour already shown to \nany person, by himself in the discharge of his official duties or in relation to any \nmatter connected with the functions, affairs or business of a Government \ndepartment, public body or other organisation or institution in which he is \nserving as a public official, or \n  \n(ii)            anything to be afterwards done or omitted, or any favour or disfavour to be \nafterwards shown to any person, by himself in the discharge of his official \nduties or in relation to any such matter as aforesaid, is guilty of the felony of \nofficial corruption and is liable to imprisonment for seven years. \n  \n(2)            If in any proceedings for an offence under this section it is proved that any property or \nbenefit of any kind, or any promise thereof, was received by a public official, or by some \nother person\n\n by the Rules or fixed by \nany order of the Court for doing any act or taking any proceeding.  \n182. Defects and irregularity not to invalidate proceedings  \n(1) No proceedings under the Act or these Rules shall be invalidated by any formal defe ct  or by any irregularity, \nunless the Court before which an objection is made to the proceeding is of the opinion that injustice has been \ncaused by the defect or irregularity and that the injustice cannot be remedied by any order of that Court.  \n(2) No defect or irregularity in the appoi ntment  or election of an Official Receiver, Liquidator or member \n\nprosecution for an offence under the provisions of this section of this Code shall not be \ncommenced except by, or with the consent of, a law officer.  \n                                                                           CHAPTER 12  \n                                                               Corruption and abuse of office  \n98. Official corruption: public official inviting bribes, etc., on account of own actions      \n  (1) Any publi\nc official (as defined in section 98D) who‐  \n  (a)   corruptly asks for, receives or obtains any property or benefit of any kind for himself or  \n  any  other person; or  \n[1966 No. 84.] \n  (b)   corruptly agrees or attempts to \n\n is founded on a \nconviction or judgment sufficient to sustain it. \n \n PART 32 - COSTS, COMPENSATION, DAMAGES AND RESTITUTION \n \n \n319.
