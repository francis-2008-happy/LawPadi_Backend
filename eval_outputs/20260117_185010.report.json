According to this provision, the Constitution is supreme and its provisions shall have binding force on all authorities and persons throughout the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nSpecifically, Section 1(1) states that \"This Constitution is supreme and its provisions shall have binding force on all authorities and persons throughout the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\" This means that the Constitution is the highest law of the land, and all other laws, authorities, and persons are subject to its provisions.\n\nFurthermore, Section 1(2) provides that \"The Federal Republic of Nigeria shall not be governed, nor shall any persons or group of persons take control of the Government of Nigeria or any part thereof, except in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.\" This implies that the government and all persons must exercise their powers and functions in accordance with the Constitution.\n\nIn addition, Section 1(3) states that \"If any other law is inconsistent with the provisions of this Constitution, this Constitution shall prevail, and that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.\" This means that if any other law conflicts with the Constitution, the Constitution shall take precedence, and the conflicting law shall be null and void to the extent of the inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, the supremacy of the Nigerian Constitution means that it is the highest authority in the land, and all other laws, authorities, and persons are subject to its provisions. This provision is designed to ensure that the Constitution is upheld and respected by all, and that the rule of law is maintained in the country.\n\nAuthority: Section 1, Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended).",

Section 5 of the Constitution vests the executive powers of the Federation in the President, while Section 6 vests the judicial powers of the Federation in the courts.\n\nThe separation of powers is further reinforced by the provisions of Sections 4, 5, and 6 of the Constitution, which provide that each arm of government has distinct and separate powers and functions. For instance, the National Assembly has the power to make laws, the President has the power to execute the laws, and the courts have the power to interpret the laws.\n\nThe doctrine of separation of powers is designed to prevent any one arm of government from dominating the others, and to ensure that power is distributed evenly among the three arms. This is to prevent abuse of power and to ensure that each arm of government checks and balances the others.\n\nIn the case of Attorney-General of Abia State v.

However, the Criminal Code Act, which is applicable in the Southern part of Nigeria, provides for the punishment of murder in Section 319. According to this section, any person who unlawfully kills another person is guilty of murder and is liable to imprisonment for life.\n\nFurthermore, Section 316 of the Criminal Code Act provides that a person is deemed to have unlawfully killed another person if they intentionally cause the death of that person, or if they cause the death of that person with the intention of causing them grievous harm, or if they cause the death of that person with the knowledge that their act is likely to cause the death of that person.\n\nIn addition, the Supreme Court of Nigeria has held in various cases that murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. The court has also established that malice aforethought can be established by proof of an intention to kill, or an intention to cause grievous harm, or recklessness as to the consequences of one's actions.\n\nRELEVANT AUTHORITY:\n- Section 316 of the Criminal Code Act\n- Section 319 of the Criminal Code Act\n- The State v.

      "expected_answer": "Murder involves intent to kill or cause grievous harm, while manslaughter involves unlawful killing without such intent.",
      "model_answer": "DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MURDER AND MANSLAUGHTER\n\nThe difference between murder and manslaughter is primarily based on the intent and circumstances surrounding the killing. According to the Criminal Code, murder is defined in Section 316 as the unlawful killing of another person under certain circumstances, including where the offender intends to cause the death of the person killed or that of some other person, or where the offender intends to do to the person killed or to some other person some grievous harm.\n\nOn the other hand, manslaughter is defined in Section 317 as the unlawful killing of another person in such circumstances as not to constitute murder. This implies that manslaughter is a lesser offence than murder, and it is often characterized by a lack of intent to kill or a mitigating circumstance that reduces the culpability of the offender.\n\nIn particular, Section 318 of the Criminal Code provides that when a person who unlawfully kills another is guilty of an offence which is called manslaughter if the killing was done in the heat of passion, and before there is time for the passion to cool. This suggests that manslaughter may be applicable in situations where the killing was not premeditated or intentional, but was rather a spontaneous reaction to a provocation.\n\nIn summary, the key differences between murder and manslaughter are:\n\n1. Intent: Murder requires an intent to kill or cause grievous harm, while manslaughter does not.\n2. Circumstances: Murder is often characterized by a deliberate and premeditated act, while manslaughter may be the result of a spontaneous or impulsive act.\n3. Culpability: Murder is generally considered a more serious offence than manslaughter, and is punishable by death, while manslaughter is punishable by imprisonment.\n\nRelevant authorities:\n- Section 316 of the Criminal Code (Definition of Murder)\n- Section 317 of the Criminal Code (Definition of Manslaughter)\n- Section 318 of the Criminal Code (Killing on Provocation)",

Habeas Corpus: This is a writ that can be brought before a court to challenge the legality of a person's detention. According to the Constitution, a person who is unlawfully detained can apply to a court for a writ of habeas corpus, which can order the person's release if the detention is found to be unlawful (Section 32 of the Constitution).\n\n2. Bail: If a person is arrested without a warrant, they can be released on bail by the police officer in charge of the station, subject to certain conditions (Section 30 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015).\n\n3. Fundamental Rights Enforcement: A person who has been unlawfully arrested can also bring an action to enforce their fundamental rights under the Constitution, including the right to personal liberty, freedom from torture, and the right to a fair hearing (Chapter IV of the Constitution).\n\n4. Civil Action for Damages: A person who has been unlawfully arrested can also bring a civil action for damages against the person or authority responsible for the arrest (Section 35 of the Constitution).\n\n5. Complaint to the Police: A person who has been unlawfully arrested can also make a complaint to the police, which can lead to an investigation and possible disciplinary action against the officer responsible for the arrest (Section 29 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015).\n\nIn conclusion, Nigerian law provides several legal remedies for unlawful arrest, including habeas corpus, bail, fundamental rights enforcement, civil action for damages, and complaint to the police.

      "model_answer": "LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK\nThe Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Armed Forces Act are the primary sources of law governing the jurisdiction of military courts in Nigeria.\n\nJURISDICTION OF MILITARY COURTS\nUnder the Armed Forces Act, military courts have jurisdiction to try military personnel for offenses committed under the Act. However, the Act does not confer jurisdiction on military courts to try civilians.\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS\nSection 217 of the Constitution empowers the National Assembly to make laws for the regulation of the armed forces, but it does not extend the jurisdiction of military courts to civilians. Section 6 of the Constitution vests judicial powers in the courts established by the Constitution, which includes the regular courts and not military courts, to try civilians.\n\nLIMITATIONS ON MILITARY COURTS\nThe Armed Forces Act and the Constitution do not provide for the trial of civilians by military courts. The Act only applies to persons subject to service law, which excludes civilians.\n\nAUTHORITY\nThe Supreme Court of Nigeria has consistently held that military courts do not have jurisdiction to try civilians. In the case of Lakanmi v. The State (1970) 6 NSCC 143, the court held that a civilian cannot be tried by a military court.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, under Nigerian law, military courts do not have the jurisdiction to try civilians. The Armed Forces Act and the Constitution only confer jurisdiction on military courts to try military personnel for offenses committed under the Act. Civilians can only be tried by the regular courts established by the Constitution.

The memorandum of association of a public company must state that it is a public company.\n\nSome key differences between private and public companies include:\n\n1. **Restriction on transfer of shares**: Private companies are required to restrict the transfer of their shares, while public companies are not subject to this restriction.\n2. **Number of members**: The total number of members of a private company shall not exceed 50, not including persons who are bona fide in the employment of the company, as provided in section 22(3) of the Act.\n3. **Invitation to the public**: A private company shall not, unless authorised by law, invite the public to subscribe for any share or debenture of the company, or deposit money for fixed periods or payable at call, as stated in section 22(5) of the Act.\n\nIn summary, the main difference between a private and public company lies in their structure, membership, and ability to invite the public to subscribe for shares or deposit money. \n\nRelevant authorities:\n- Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020, section 22\n- Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020, section 24",

      "model_answer": "DUTIES OF DIRECTORS\nThe duties of directors of banks under the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA) 2020 are not explicitly stated in the Act. However, the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) 2020, which applies to all companies in Nigeria, including banks, provides for the duties of directors.\n\nAccording to Section 279 of the CAMA 2020, a director of a company, including a bank, stands in a fiduciary relationship towards the company and shall observe the utmost good faith towards the company in any transaction with it or on its behalf. A director shall also owe a fiduciary relationship with the company in certain circumstances, including where a director is acting as an agent of a particular shareholder or where a shareholder or other person is dealing with the company's securities.\n\nFurthermore, Section 279(3) of the CAMA 2020 provides that a director shall act at all times in what he believes to be the best interest of the company. This implies that bank directors have a duty to act in the best interest of the bank and its shareholders, and to observe the utmost good faith in all their dealings with the bank.\n\nIn addition, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) may also issue guidelines and regulations that outline the duties and responsibilities of bank directors. These guidelines may include requirements for bank directors to ensure the bank's safety and soundness, to comply with regulatory requirements, and to act with integrity and transparency.\n\nIn summary, the duties of bank directors under BOFIA 2020 are not explicitly stated, but are governed by the provisions of the CAMA 2020 and any guidelines or regulations issued by the CBN. The duties include acting in the best interest of the bank, observing the utmost good faith, and complying with regulatory requirements. \n\nRelevant authority: \n- Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020, Section 279.\n- Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act, 2020.",

      "model_answer": "DEFINITION OF BANK FRAUD\n\nUnder Nigerian law, bank fraud is not explicitly defined in a single statute. However, various provisions in different Acts provide insight into what constitutes bank fraud.\n\n- The Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA) Cap. B3, LFN 2004, does not provide a direct definition of bank fraud. However, it outlines various offenses related to banking operations, including fraudulent transactions and false accounting.\n\n- The Failed Banks (Recovery of Debts) and Financial Malpractices in Banks Act, 1995 No. 18, also does not provide a direct definition of bank fraud. Nevertheless, it defines \"fraudulent, fictitious or artificial transaction\" as a disposal or purchase made with the intention of defrauding a bank.\n\n- Section 434 of the Criminal Code Act, Cap. C38, LFN 2004, provides that any person who, being a trustee or officer of a company or corporation, fraudulently disposes of trust property, commits a felony and is liable to imprisonment.\n\n- Furthermore, Section 1(1) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Related Offences Act, 2006, defines advance fee fraud, which is a type of bank fraud, as a person who, by any false pretence, and with the intention to defraud, obtains or induces any other person to deliver to him or to another person, any property or valuable consideration.\n\nAUTHORITY\n\nThe relevant authorities for the above provisions are:\n1. The Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA) Cap. B3, LFN 2004\n2. The Failed Banks (Recovery of Debts) and Financial Malpractices in Banks Act, 1995 No. 18\n3. The Criminal Code Act, Cap.

However, this provision does not apply to fintech companies as they are not public companies in the classical sense.\n\nFURTHER AUTHORITY\nSection 2 of the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act, Cap. B3, LFN 2004, defines a financial institution to include a bank, discount house, or other financial institution as may be prescribed by the Central Bank of Nigeria. Fintech companies may not fall within this definition unless specifically prescribed by the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn the absence of specific legislation or regulations permitting fintech companies to accept deposits, it is unlikely that such companies can accept deposits legally under Nigerian law.

This is supported by the provision of Section 141(1) of the Evidence Act, which states that the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any exception or exemption from, or qualification to, the operation of the law creating the offence with which he is charged, is upon the accused person.\n\nIt is also important to note that the burden of proof may shift during the course of a case, as provided in Section 139 of the Evidence Act.

According to Section 29 of the Evidence Act, a confession made by a defendant may be rejected if it was obtained by oppression of the person who made it, or in consequence of anything said or done which was likely to render unreliable any confession which might be made by him. \n\nFurthermore, Section 28 of the Evidence Act provides that a confession caused by inducement, threat or promise is irrelevant in criminal proceedings. Additionally, a confession made under a promise of secrecy, or in consequence of a deception practised on the accused person for the purpose of obtaining it, or when he was drunk, or because it was made in answer to questions which he need not have answered, may also be rejected.\n\nThe court has the discretion to reject a confessional statement if it is of the opinion that the confession was not made voluntarily, or if it was obtained under circumstances that render it unreliable. This is in line with the provisions of Section 29 of the Evidence Act, which requires the court to exclude a confession if it is represented to the court that the confession was or may have been obtained by oppression or in consequence of anything said or done which was likely to render unreliable any confession which might be made by the defendant. \n\nIn the case of R v. Igwe (1960) NRNLR 155, the court held that a confession obtained by oppression or under circumstances that render it unreliable is inadmissible. Similarly, in the case of Onafowokan v. The State (1987) 3 NWLR (Part 61) 538, the court held that a confession made under duress or coercion is not admissible as evidence. \n\nIn conclusion, confessional statements can be rejected if they were obtained under circumstances that render them unreliable or if they were made under duress, coercion or oppression. The court has the discretion to reject such statements and will do so if it is of the opinion that the confession was not made voluntarily or if it was obtained under circumstances that render it unreliable.",

      "model_answer": "DISTINCTION BETWEEN TRIAL AND APPELLATE COURTS\n\nThe distinction between trial and appellate courts is a fundamental concept in the Nigerian judicial system. The primary difference between the two lies in their functions and the nature of proceedings conducted before them.\n\nTrial courts, such as the Magistrate Court or the High Court, are courts of first instance where cases are initially heard and determined. Section 241 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015, provides that trials shall be held in the Magistrate Court or any other court or tribunal exercising criminal jurisdiction. The primary function of trial courts is to receive evidence, determine facts, and apply the law to the facts of a case to arrive at a judgment or verdict.\n\nOn the other hand, appellate courts, such as the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, are courts of review that hear appeals from decisions of lower courts. Section 241 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), provides that an appeal shall lie from decisions of the Federal High Court or a High Court to the Court of Appeal as of right in certain cases. The primary function of appellate courts is to review decisions of lower courts for errors of law or fact, and to correct any injustices that may have occurred during the trial.\n\nIn summary, the key differences between trial and appellate courts are:\n\n1. **Function**: Trial courts determine cases at first instance, while appellate courts review decisions of lower courts.\n2. **Proceedings**: Trial courts receive evidence and determine facts, while appellate courts review records of proceedings from lower courts.\n3. **Jurisdiction**: Trial courts have original jurisdiction over cases, while appellate courts have appellate jurisdiction over decisions of lower courts.\n\nRelevant authorities:\n- Section 241 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015\n- Section 241 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended)\n- Section 28 of the Supreme Court Act, 1990 (as amended)",

Nigerian Breweries Plc (2013) 12 NWLR (Pt. 1368) 1, the Court of Appeal held that striking out and dismissal are two different concepts, and that striking out is a more drastic measure that can be taken by the court in certain circumstances. \n\nIn the context of the provided text, subsection (6) of the relevant section also refers to an appeal being \"struck out for want of prosecution\", which further supports the position that a case can be struck out instead of dismissed. \n\nTherefore, based on the Nigerian legal authority, it is clear that a case can be struck out instead of dismissed, and the two terms are not interchangeable.",

Attorney-General of the Federation (2002) 6 NWLR (Pt. 764) 542, locus standi means the right to institute an action in a court of law. The court held that a plaintiff must have a sufficient interest in the subject matter of the litigation to justify the court's exercise of jurisdiction.\n\nIn order to establish locus standi, a plaintiff must show that he has a direct and personal interest in the matter being litigated, and that he is not a mere busybody or meddlesome interloper. The plaintiff must also demonstrate that he has suffered or is likely to suffer a specific injury or harm as a result of the defendant's actions or inactions.\n\nThe Nigerian courts have consistently held that locus standi is a fundamental requirement for the institution of an action in court. In the case of Chief Gani Fawehinmi v. Nigerian Bar Association (1987) 4 NWLR (Pt. 67) 1, the Court of Appeal held that locus standi is a threshold issue that must be resolved in favour of the plaintiff before the court can proceed to consider the merits of the case.\n\nIn conclusion, locus standi is a critical concept in Nigerian law that determines whether a person has the right to bring an action or to be heard in a court of law.

This means that the claimant will be prevented from pursuing the claim, regardless of its merits.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the court may grant an extension of time in certain circumstances, as provided for in the rules of court. For example, under the rules of court, an extension of time may be granted upon such conditions as the court thinks fit, and the costs of the application may be borne by the applicant, unless the court otherwise orders.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the Limitation Law and the rules of court, such as the Limitation Law of Lagos State, Cap L3, Laws of Lagos State, 2003, and the Federal High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2019, provide the framework for the limitation of actions in Nigeria.\n\nIn the context of maritime law, the Merchant Shipping Act, 2007, provides for the limitation of liability for shipowners and salvors, and the effect of limitation of actions in this context is to limit the amount of damages that a claimant can recover from a shipowner or salvor, rather than to bar the claim entirely.\n\nIn summary, the effect of limitation of actions is to bar a claimant from bringing an action after a certain period of time has elapsed, unless an extension of time is granted by the court.

      "model_answer": "BINDING EFFECT OF SUPREME COURT DECISIONS\n\nThe binding effect of Supreme Court decisions is a fundamental principle in the Nigerian legal system. According to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the Supreme Court is the highest court in the land, and its decisions are binding on all other courts.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decisions have the same force and effect as if all the Justices who heard the case were present in court and had declared their opinions in person, as provided in Section 12 of the Supreme Court Act. This means that the judgment of the court is final and binding on the parties to the case, and it is also binding on all lower courts in Nigeria.\n\nFurthermore, the Supreme Court has the power to determine the real question in controversy in an appeal, and its decisions on such matters are binding on all parties, as provided in Section 22 of the Supreme Court Act. The Court may also make any order necessary for determining the real question in controversy, and such orders are binding on all parties.\n\nIn addition, the Supreme Court's decisions on questions of law are binding on all lower courts in Nigeria, as provided in Section 235 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999. This means that once the Supreme Court has decided on a point of law, all lower courts are bound to follow that decision in similar cases.\n\nIn summary, the binding effect of Supreme Court decisions is as follows:\n1. The Supreme Court's decisions are binding on all parties to the case.\n2. The Court's decisions are binding on all lower courts in Nigeria.\n3. The Court's decisions on questions of law are binding on all lower courts in Nigeria.\n\nRelevant authorities:\n- Section 12 of the Supreme Court Act\n- Section 22 of the Supreme Court Act\n- Section 235 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999.",

      "model_answer": "LEGAL POSITION\nThe Supreme Court, as the highest court in Nigeria, has the final say on matters of law. However, the question of whether the Supreme Court can overrule itself is not directly addressed in the Constitution or the Supreme Court Act.\n\nRELEVANT AUTHORITY\nSection 235 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) provides that the Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other court to hear and determine appeals from the Court of Appeal. However, it does not explicitly state whether the Supreme Court can overrule its previous decisions.\n\nCASE LAW\nIn the case of Adegoke Motors Ltd. v. Adesanya (1989) 3 NWLR (Pt. 109) 250, the Supreme Court held that it is not bound by its previous decisions and can overrule them if it considers it necessary to do so in the interest of justice. This decision suggests that the Supreme Court has the power to overrule its previous decisions, although it is not a common practice.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, while there is no explicit provision in the Constitution or the Supreme Court Act that allows the Supreme Court to overrule itself, the court has held in a previous decision that it has the power to do so in the interest of justice. Therefore, it can be argued that the Supreme Court can overrule itself, but this power is exercised sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances.\n\nCITATION\nAdegoke Motors Ltd. v.

      "model_answer": "INTRODUCTION\nThe concept of ratio decidendi is a fundamental principle in the Nigerian legal system, particularly in the realm of judicial precedent. \n\nDEFINITION OF RATIO DECIDENDI\nRatio decidendi refers to the reason or principle of law that determines the outcome of a case. It is the core or essential reasoning that underlies a judicial decision, and it is this reasoning that is binding on lower courts in subsequent cases. \n\nAPPLICATION OF RATIO DECIDENDI\nIn Nigerian law, the ratio decidendi of a case is the principle of law that is essential to the decision reached by the court. It is the legal principle that is applied to the facts of the case to arrive at the judgment. The ratio decidendi is distinguishable from obiter dicta, which are statements made by the court that are not essential to the decision.\n\nAUTHORITY\nThe concept of ratio decidendi is supported by various Nigerian cases, including the case of Adebayo v. Abidogun (2008) 18 NWLR (Pt. 1119) 1, where the Court of Appeal held that the ratio decidendi of a case is the principle of law that is essential to the decision reached by the court.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, the ratio decidendi is a crucial concept in Nigerian law, as it represents the underlying principle of law that determines the outcome of a case. It is essential for legal practitioners and judges to identify the ratio decidendi of a case in order to apply the correct principle of law in subsequent cases.",

It is a statement made by a judge that is not essential to the decision of the case.\n2. It is not necessary for the resolution of the issue before the court.\n3. It does not form part of the ratio decidendi of the case.\n4.

This principle is based on the doctrine of stare decisis, which means \"to stand by things decided\".\n\nIn Nigeria, the doctrine of judicial precedent is recognized and applied by the courts. The Supreme Court, being the highest court in the land, has the final say on matters of law and its decisions are binding on all lower courts. The Court of Appeal, Federal High Court, and other lower courts are bound to follow the decisions of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal in similar cases.\n\nThe relevance of judicial precedent is highlighted in Section 49 of the Evidence Act, which provides that previous judgments are relevant to bar a second suit or trial. Additionally, Section 50 of the Evidence Act provides that a final judgment, order, or decree of a competent court is relevant in certain jurisdictions.\n\nThe judicial precedent is also supported by the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which establishes the hierarchy of courts and the principle of stare decisis.

This is because Section 16 of the Act specifically states that customary law must not be incompatible with any written law, which includes statutory law.\n\nFurthermore, Section 16 (b) of the Act states that a customary court may also administer the provisions of any written law which the court may be authorized to enforce by an order made pursuant to the provisions of this Act. This implies that statutory law takes precedence over customary law, and customary courts are required to apply statutory law where applicable.\n\nIn conclusion, customary law cannot override statutory law in Nigeria. Customary law is subject to the limitations imposed by statutory law, and customary courts are required to apply statutory law where applicable.\n\nRELEVANT AUTHORITY:\n- Federal Capital Territory Customary Court Act 2007, Section 16\n- Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, Section 6 (4) (a) and (5) (j)",

Section 144 of the Act prohibits the removal of a child from one state to another, or from Nigeria to another country, for the purpose of adoption, except under a license issued by the Minister. Section 147 of the Act also prohibits the marriage between an adopted parent and the adopted child.\n\nJURISDICTION OF THE COURT\nThe Court has exclusive jurisdiction to deal with adoption matters, and the Chief Justice of Nigeria has the power to make rules of court for regulating the practice and procedure of the Court in respect of adoption. Section 136 of the Act states that the Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to deal with an application for an adoption order, while section 137 of the Act empowers the Chief Justice to make rules of court for regulating the practice and procedure of the Court in respect of adoption.\n\nIn conclusion, the legal status of adoption in Nigeria is governed by the Adoption Act, which recognizes adoption orders made under the Act, as well as adoptions made under the law of any other country. The Act imposes certain restrictions on adoption, including the requirement that the adoption must be in the best interest of the child, and the Court has exclusive jurisdiction to deal with adoption matters.\n\nAUTHORITY:\nAdoption Act, sections 136, 137, 144, 146, and 147.",

The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria does not provide a general immunity for public officers after they leave office. \n2. Section 308 of the Constitution provides immunity for the President, Vice-President, Governors, and Deputy Governors while they are in office, but this immunity does not extend to them after they leave office.\n3. The Criminal Code, which applies to public officers, does not provide any immunity for public officers after they leave office.\n4. In fact, Section 98C of the Criminal Code specifically provides that a judicial officer cannot be arrested without warrant for an offence under sections 98, 98A, or 98B, but it does not provide any immunity from prosecution after leaving office.\n5. Furthermore, the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act, which regulates the conduct of public officers, provides that a public officer can be prosecuted for any breach of the code of conduct after leaving office.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the Nigerian law, public officers can be prosecuted after leaving office for any offences committed while they were in office.

Yusuf (2017) LPELR-42513(CA), the Court of Appeal held that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has the power to obtain an interim forfeiture order before the conviction of a defendant.\n\nTherefore, based on the provisions of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Establishment) Act, 2004, and the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency Act, as well as the decision of the Court of Appeal in FRN v. Yusuf (2017) LPELR-42513(CA), it can be concluded that assets can be forfeited before conviction in Nigeria.\n\nCITATIONS:\n- Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Establishment) Act, 2004, sections 28 and 29\n- National Drug Law Enforcement Agency Act, section 36\n- FRN v.

The prosecution may enter into plea bargaining with the defendant, with the consent of the victim or his representative, during or after the presentation of the evidence of the prosecution, but before the presentation of the evidence of the defence, provided that certain conditions are present.\n\nThese conditions include: \n1. the evidence of the prosecution is insufficient to prove the offence charged beyond reasonable doubt; \n2. the defendant has agreed to return the proceeds of the crime or make restitution to the victim or his representative; or \n3. the defendant, in a case of conspiracy, has fully cooperated with the investigation and prosecution of the crime by providing relevant information for the successful prosecution of other offenders.\n\nThe prosecutor and the defendant or his legal practitioner may, before the plea to the charge, enter into an agreement in respect of the term of the plea bargain, which may include the sentence recommended within the appropriate range of punishment stipulated for the offence or a plea of guilty by the defendant to the offence charged or a lesser offence of which he may be convicted on the charge. \n\nThe Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015, provides the framework for plea bargaining in Nigeria, and it is subject to the Court's approval.",

      "model_answer": "CORRUPTION CASES UNDER NIGERIAN LAW\n\nThe legal position in Nigeria is that corruption cases cannot be settled out of court. According to Section 98 of the Criminal Code, a public official who corruptly asks for, receives, or obtains any property or benefit of any kind for himself or any other person is guilty of the felony of official corruption and is liable to imprisonment for seven years.\n\nFurthermore, Section 309 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015, provides that prosecution for an offence under the provisions of the Criminal Code shall not be commenced except by, or with the consent of, a law officer. This implies that corruption cases are to be prosecuted through the formal judicial process.\n\nAdditionally, Section 319 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015, provides that a court may order the defendant or convict to pay compensation to any person injured by the offence, but this is within the proceedings or while passing judgment, and not as a means of settling the case out of court.\n\nIn light of these provisions, it is clear that corruption cases under Nigerian law are to be prosecuted through the formal judicial process and cannot be settled out of court. Any attempt to settle such cases out of court would be contrary to the law and may be considered an obstruction of justice.\n\nAuthorities:\n- Section 98 of the Criminal Code\n- Section 309 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015\n- Section 319 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015",
